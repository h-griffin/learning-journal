# history of computers
computers used to be a large wood and metal machine and could only run numbers, they used to take a long time for simple equasions but could still operate independantly. 

# how computers work
computers operate with an input, system, output. a computer awaits information given, with that information it will follow steps and instructions on what to do with that information, and will then result in an output or response. much like a recipe or handbook, the computer will take the information like a list of ingredients, and will follow a recipe or instruction manual on what to do with that information. by the time the lis of directions is done it will result in a final product, the output. 

# Binary
a wire with electricity running through it can provide the computer wth an answer that has two variables such as, on/off yes/no true/false 0/1. while there are only 1s and 0s in binary, any number can be represented with the binary system. each greater value of the binary number system is multiplied by two, rather than the decimal system each place holder multiplied by 10, such as 1-10-100-1000. the binary system multiplied each place holder value by 2, 1-2-4-8, and goes on with each wire you add, with 32 wires you can have over 4 million numbers. 

# CIRCUTS AND LOGIC
a “not” circuit gives you the opposite answer it receives from the wire, if it is given yes it will give no, if it is given no it will give yes. complicated circuts can take multiple signals and combine them to give multiple answers. if an “and” circuit taking 2 signals receives a zero from either wire the answer will be zero

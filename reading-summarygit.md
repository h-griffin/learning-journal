# Version Control
Version control systems let you revisit multiple versions of the same
file or files by keeping record of each change. there are many different version controls, some are local files only, and some are distributed version controls, which creates many of the same repositories so developers can work together. git tracks data changes, and helps prevent loss of data by saving snapshots of each commit. 

# Git
git was created so that many developers could access the same local files, and have them accessable anywhere in the world. git can support many large seperate projects, and records each commit so that each version of the file is accesable without getting cluttured. 

# git Commands
there are multiple commands to use in git to find specific information you need. git will show you tracked and untracked files, different directories, and what is in the directory. it can view a file status, and recomend you the next steps in completing a commit.
